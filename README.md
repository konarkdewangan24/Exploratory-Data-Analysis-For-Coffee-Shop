Coffee Shop Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Coffee Shop Sales dataset containing six months of transactional data. The dataset includes information such as date, location, product details, quantity sold, and sales amount. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the project covers essential steps including data import, inspection, cleaning, and modification to prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis.

The analysis focuses on understanding sales distribution across different store locations, evaluating product performance, and identifying sales trends over time. After handling missing values and restructuring the dataset, several visualizations and statistical insights were generated. The results show that the coffee shop earned a total revenue of $673,839.8 from 214,470 units sold over six months. Among the three store locations, Astoria contributed the highest revenue of $226,830.7, while coffee emerged as the most popular and profitable product, generating $285,600 from 89,250 units sold. On the other hand, packaged chocolate recorded the lowest sales, with only 487 units sold, resulting in $1,217.5 revenue.

A key observation from the trend analysis is that sales have shown a continuous upward growth across the six-month period, reflecting strong business momentum and increasing customer demand. Location-specific insights also confirm that coffee remains the leading product across Astoria, Hellâ€™s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan, with each location consistently showing coffee as the highest revenue generator.

Through this analysis, it becomes evident that while the business is experiencing healthy growth, certain low-performing products may require targeted promotional strategies. The project demonstrates practical applications of data analysis, visualization, and storytelling with data, ultimately highlighting how EDA can be leveraged to drive business decisions in the retail sector.
